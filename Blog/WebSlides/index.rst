`Sphinx <http:\\Sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `reStructuredText (RST) <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ are great to
build *and maintain* documentation. However, the ability for “slide deck” is limited. In practice, most of my presentation
are made by `PowerPoint` or `Keynote` -- and so, are hard to maintain.

There are options however, both with and without Sphinx. `Hieroglyph <http://docs.hieroglyph.io>`_ by example, adds a
*builder* to Sphinx, for HTML-based presentation. Whereas `reveal.js <https://revealjs.com>`_ uses (simplified) html
with a javascript-library  which is used.  Html isn’t the simplest way to author (& maintain) slides; there are many
attempts to generate revealjs from RST, MD (etc). And revealjs has even a option to use markdown.

In this chapter, several articles (or blogs: :ref:`category-webslides`) give an overview.
