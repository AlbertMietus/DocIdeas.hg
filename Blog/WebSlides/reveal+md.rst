`Reveal.js <https://revealjs.com>`_ (`@gitgub <https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js>`_) is a open-source (MIT-Licensed)
HTML-Framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. -- According to there website. It has a nice
`live demo <http://revealjs.com>`_ too.

As a cons however, it assumes you speak fluently html, javascript and are willing to read the code to understand the
option. Or, use the (non open-source) online editor. That does not fit to my wishes ...

However there is an option to use markdown! It comes standard with a plugin to handle several dialects [#dialects]_ of
markdown [#marked]_. Although md [#dialects]_ is not *rst*, it is text-based. And so easy to maintain.

   This is still a drawback: `md` is hardly standard language! (unlike `rst`)
