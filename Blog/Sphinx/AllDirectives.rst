   `Sphinx <http:\\Sphinx-doc.org>`_ comes with a huge number of *directives*. Some are inherited from `RST
   <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_, others come from the many extensions that are available. But the is no

The most used directives to document Sphinx itself
==================================================

With a simple iPython-script, I counted all directives in all (`.rst` & `.py`) files of `Sphinx-doc
<https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx.git>`_ (*the latest version, on May 10, 2018*); 1758 in total. The table below
shows them all, sorted in most-used-order.  As you can seem many directives are only used once (`0.06%`) or twice ...
