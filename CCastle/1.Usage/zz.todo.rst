Matching Statements (todo)
==========================

.. todo::

   * “Matching” in a (e.g.) tree-structure

     - Have to look to CSS-selectors
     - Have a look to XPATH (as used in XLST)

   * To be used as **Visitors** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern)

   * Replace the “actions” in a grammar.

     .. seealso:: :ref:`G2C-actions`

.. _Declarative-programming:

Declarative programming (todo)
==============================

.. todo::

   * I like a declarative style

     - describe what you need; not how to implement (the details)

   * Makefiles are a good example

   * Argparse (vs loop over argv) is a second example

   .. note:: CCastle: blog: “(1) declare what you need”. Declarative style programing. Eg loop over Argv vs argparse, makefiles
