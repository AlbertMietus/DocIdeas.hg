TODO (Usage)
************

.. _Asym-Ops:

The Walruss in the room (todo)
==============================

.. todo::

   * Basic rules on operators:  Only when LHS and RHS are  interchangeable , the symbol is symetric

     - Assignment: ‘:=’, the walrus-operators; aka Pascal’s becomes
     - equality : ‘==’
     - connect in/out ports: ‘=’

   * Reason: the language should reduce the risk on mistakses that lead to errors. In C/C++ : ``if (a=2) ...``

.. _matching-statements:

Matching Statements (todo)
==========================

.. todo::

   * “Matching” in a (e.g.) tree-structure

     - Have to look to CSS-selectors
     - Have a look to XPATH (as used in XLST)

   * To be used as **Visitors** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern)

   * Replace the “actions” in a grammar.

     .. seealso::

        * :ref:`G2C-actions`
        * :ref:`CyclicWoods`


.. _Declarative-programming:

Declarative programming (todo)
==============================

.. todo::

   * I like a declarative style

     - describe what you need; not how to implement (the details)

   * Makefiles are a good example

   * Argparse (vs loop over argv) is a second example

   .. note:: CCastle: blog: “(1) declare what you need”. Declarative style programing. Eg loop over Argv vs argparse, makefiles


.. _CyclicWoods:

Cyclic woods (todo)
===================

.. todo:: Generalise and abstract the famous tree-structure and allow cycles 

   E.g. a AST is tree with “cycles”: Each var is defined and used. Use “href” alike

   .. seealso:: Its is (maybed) related to :ref:`matching-statements`

.. _CC:

Concurrent//Connected Components (ToDo)
=======================================

.. todo:: Write a few blog about the CC-concept

.. _XXX:

.. _CC-example-Sieve:
