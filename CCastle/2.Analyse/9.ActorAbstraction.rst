   The Actor-Model_ which is inspired by physics, unlike older models like the famous Petri-net_ that are mostly
   mathematical. And has become popular for Distributed-Computing_, where each node/computing act as in independent,
   active actor.

   As an abstraction, those active actors are similar to the :ref:`”Many Core” concept<CC>` we use for CCastle. Hence, we study this model a bit  more
