My ambition:

   Castle: 'The best Real-Time/Embedded/Technical/System language, EVER'.**

   --ALbert Mietus

It’s also the first programming-language that support **CC**: Connected Components. Where `CC` is kind of of the
successor of OO: active ‘things’ that communicate (solely) by input *and* output ports ... 
   

Castle2
=======
**CCastle2** is the second attempt, and the successor of CC-Castle, a project that is stalled and stopped.

It incorporates moderen SW-Enginering concepts as DSL/MDE *(Model-based development)*; where the domain is Technical
and/or Embedded-Systems. It focuses on high quality ‘always on’ and/or flawless systems; including real-time systems,
kernel-drivers, compilers, etc. It also expects and support both low-end (“cheap”) SoC (System-on-Chip) systems, and
CPU’s with many, many cores (hundreds to thousands!).

DocIdeas
========
This section contains a set of pages & blog-post on this topic. Some a design-studies, some explain how to use the language, some are ... just notes.


‘One day’ the pages will be incorporated into the (docs of, the source of) `CCastle2 <https://osdn.net/users/albertmietus/pf/CCastle2>`_
