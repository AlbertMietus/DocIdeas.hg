   As described in `FSMs-are-needed` *Finit State Machines* are great and needed -- even tough no (main) programming
   language has syntax support for it. But there are other (computer) language that (more-or-less) support the
   corresponding `State pattern`_.
   |BR|
   By example plantUML_ --very populair by mature developers-- has a syntax to draw them

   What can we learn for them? That is the topic of this post, before we define the Castle syntax
