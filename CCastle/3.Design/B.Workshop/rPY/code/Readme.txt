This directory contains a copy of my Sieve_in_rPython (https://osdn.net/users/albertmietus/pf/CC_Sieve_in_rPython) code as on Sept 14, 2023.

By having a local copy, it is possible to generate the documentation locally and/or on ReadTheDocs
(http://docideas.mietus.nl/en/default/CCastle/3.Design/B.Workshop/rPY).

Aside of that, it is possible to improve the Sieve_in_rPython code, without breaking the docs (line-numbers in
`.. literalinclude::`, ect)
