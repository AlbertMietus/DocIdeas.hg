Castle has to be designed. Both the :ref:`language <Language-Desing>`, all  :ref:`Tools <Workshop-Design>`. You will
find a collection of (quick) notes here.

.. tip::

   QuickNotes are short, quick, informal notes. Often to orden my thoughts, analyse the options before I write the “real”
   design (or other docs)

   They are unofficialy published. You can read them, but do not espect well written, or that they will be maintened.
