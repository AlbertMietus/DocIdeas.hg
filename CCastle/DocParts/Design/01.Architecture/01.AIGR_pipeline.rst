======================
Architectural overview
======================

The (new) CastleCompiler(s) share a common "pipeline" architecture. Which is flexible, both in functionality and
implementation, as they share the :ref:`AIGR <AIGR>` --see below -- for input and/or output.

AIGR pipeline
==============

The pipeline starts with source, in text format, that is explored by the :ref:`Readers` and translated in the
:ref:`AIGR`. The next components all read this format, like the :ref:`Transformers`,  that transform it to a "better"
form -- see later. Last, the `AIGR` is converted into a binary by (one of the) the :ref:`Backends`
|BR|
Most :ref:`Backends` consist of two main parts: the :ref:`Writers` (which is part of CCastle), and a *Translator*: an
external *compiler* that translate/compiles the generated intermediate code into a binary.

.. uml:: AIGR_pipeline.puml

As the `AIGR` is a format (not a call-interface!), this architecture gives flexibility on deployment of the components.
A simple (Castle)compiler can hold them as (plug-in) libraries in one process.
|BR|
Alternatively, each component can be a process, where te several processes communicate with e.g. unix-pipes, or
network-connections). And there are many more option, not only separated in space, but also in time: As the AIGR can be
serialised [#pickle]_, it is possible to save it in file, and read it for the next component, later ... 

.. Important:: Although it is possible to saving a (pickled) AIGR, that component (nor action) is **NOT** a `Writer`!

   One should typically speak about “saving” the AIGR, and “loading the (AIGR) file”. It is a feature of the
   :ref:`AIGR_component` (see below).


The Reader(s)
=============

A typical reader reads (some) source-files and then translate that, in a few steps, into the :ref:`AIGR`, as
shown below.
|BR|
The :ref:`mockReader` is different: it does output (needed) ‘`AIGR`’, and so can act as the starts of a
pipeline (and therefor considered as a ‘`Reader`’), but has no input.

.. uml:: AIGR_Reader.puml

Some sub-components in the ‘`Reader`’ may also work on the ‘`AIGR`’, as shown. The difference (to a ‘`Translator`’) is
simple: the '`Reader'` should do all error-checking, etc, to make sure the inputs (so the code of the developer) is
valid. A normal Translator (nor the '`Backend'`) should ever find errors.
|BR|
When implementing that (`Reader`) functionality is more convenient as after converting the :ref:`ATS into the AIGR
<AST-2-AIGR>` an “AIGR-analyser” is build.



Transformers
============

All ‘`Transformers`’ receive and post (a “dialect” of) the`AIGR`, pushing it into a form that van be handled by the
backend to create an efficient binary. There can be many `Transformers`, and typically several of them are run in
sequence. Other sets of `Transformers` exclude each other.
|BR|
We show two examples.

.. uml:: AIGR_Transformers.puml

FSM
---

In Castle, one can directly describe a FSM (see: :ref:`FSMs-are-needed`) including advance/extended variants. Like
the non-deterministic “NFA”s, and the “State-Charts” (known from UML), with orthogonale regions and hierarchically
‘superstates’. See :need:`U_FSM_Syntax` for the demands.
|BR|
Those FSM are initially stored “asis” in the AIGR, and step-by-step rewritten by several FSM-Transformers.

The ``FSM.NFA_2_FSM`` Transformer reworks a NFA into a (bigger, deterministic) FSM. This is a well know algorithm, such
that non-deterministic edges and epsilon-transitions are gone.
|BR|
The resulting `AIGR` has the same functionality, but is simpler to translate into a binary

Similarly, the ``FSM.SuperStates`` Transformer can “flatten” complex hierarchical FSM’s into ones that are easier to
translate into executable code.

This is an examples of set of `Transformers` that can work collectively. First, remove the non-determinisms, then handle
the SuperStates and completely transformer the (simple) FSM into regulair routines.

Machinery
---------
.. caution::
   :class: clear-none

   The Machinery part is still in development. And so, it’s **not** sure that the Machinery will be implemented as a
   `Transformer`!

‘:ref:`TheMachinery`’ is an abstraction of the technology to connect ports and send data (like events) over
them. Several implementations are possible, like direct function-calls, dispatching to concurent thread-pools, or
distributing them over a network.

Typically, one wil only use one Machinery: connecting two port with DDS, ‘sending’ an event by dispatching it whereas
the receiving event-handler expect a traditional call, will not work. By choosing one Machinery-Transformer, all
bolt-and nuts will fit.

.. caution:: This is not an requirement

   One can imagine, that (eventually) a Mixed-Machinery is used. Ultimately, only the details of each (individual)
   connection should be aligned.

   .. admonition:: Advanced example

      The *Machinery-kind* can be seen an attribute of the (super)component that holds the connections (and
      sub-component, with ports). By using that Machinery for those connections, it will work.
      |BR|
      But the (external) ports and connections of that super(component) can use another Machinery; when the
      supper-super-component’s machinery-kind attribute has another value.

   Again, this makes it complicated. But it gives flexibility: for deep-down connections we might prefer direct
   calls, but use concurent options at a (bit) higher level. And use maximal decoupling for networking-applications.

   .. note:: 

      Here, we see an example of having the “connected/concurent components” abstraction and
      ‘:ref:`TheMachinery`’ abstraction.

      The CCastle code, use “components, ports and connections” only. Later, we compiling it, the details of the
      Machinery are added.
      |BR|
      And by implementing it in/as a `Transformer` we can add more-and-more advanced options without the need to change
      the source. Only some (global) “compiler options” have to be improved.
      (many) sor


Writers & Backends
==================

The ‘`Backends`’ read the (simplified & optimised) `AIGR` and transform it to a binary that can be executed. Typically
this is a two-step approach: A ‘`Writer`’ renders the `AIGR` into a low-level intermediate [#intermediate]_ language [#lll-ex]_

The interface between the ‘`Writer`’ and the ‘Translator’ is typically file-based, and depend heavily on the chosesn
‘Translator’ -- which is not part of CCastle.
|BR|
As those two are very depending on each other, there is little commonality between various `Backend` variants.

Some examples

* The :ref:`RPy` backend/writer renders to RPython, such that (PyY’s) rpython-translator can handle it. The intermediate
  file-format is fully described by RPython: the :ref:`RPy` `Writer` needs to emit exactly that format.
* **CC2Cpy** (now defunct [#CC2Cpy-not-AIGR]_) generates standard C code, that can be translated into binaries by many
  (standard, C) compilers. So, it’s a bit more generic (then **RPy**), but still the writer is limited to C -- and so
  has to *emulate* namespaces, as that isn’t handled in C
  |BR|
  A possible variant is using C++, both as lll and translator (but as I’m not a a fan of it, somebody else has to make
  it
* Both mentioned writers are implemented in python, for now (that is the ‘py’ part of CC2Cpy).
  |BR|
  Future variants of those `Writers` will be implemented in Castle itself. This does not change the input (`AIGR`) not
  the output of the `Writers` (rpython and C). And such we can use easily upgrade the `Backend` as the `Translator` does
  not change.


.. _AIGR_component:



The AIGR auxiliary component
============================
ToDo





--------

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#pickle]
   This can be done by *pickling* in python, or using an XML format, or ...

.. [#intermediate]
   We call this low-level-language “intermediate”, as the user shouldn't care about it. And consider it as an internal
   detail of the `Backend`.
   |BR|
   Note however, other tools/environments may speak about the *“Generaring to XXX-language ...”*, which is then
   compiled in the normal way. (one may hope, the ‘generated source’ isn’t edited anymore, as old tools did allow).

   Aside of terms, it’s the same!

   .. XXX The hint below overlaps a bit. The |BR| hack is a workaround

   |BR|

   .. hint:: Generating (e.g.) C-code *sounds* like it is needed to intergrade existing code.
      |BR|
      That is an outdated view however.

      Nowadays all modern languages support a ‘FFI’ (`Foreign Function Interface
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface>`__). Castle will support that to.

.. [#lll-ex]
   A well know example of  such low-level-languages is C, or C++. But also RPython --which translate to C, first and
   then that an executable-- is can also be used.
   Other options are the ‘LLVM-IM’ and so use the LLVM (known from e.g. CLang) backend as Transformer

.. [#CC2Cpy-not-AIGR]
   Notice, the current CC2Cpy module isn’t using the AIGR, and a therefore not a Writer. However, an upcomming version
   of it  may use the AIGR as interface, making it true `Writer` and a good example.
