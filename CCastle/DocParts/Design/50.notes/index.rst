Design Notes (Partial)
======================

This are “quick and dirty” design diagrams. That where useful when created (see file-name), but may be less relevant
later.

* Sound designs, are typically worked out (adding text & view), and move to a stable, to-be-maintained, location
* Outdated ones are (will be) moved to :ref:`DocParts_Design_old` (and will never be maintained).
* the one here, a undecided, may or may-not be maintained.
